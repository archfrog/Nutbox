SUMMARY
    Asks the user a question with a GUI dialog and returns suitable exit code.

SYNOPSIS
    "ask" *option +word

DESCRIPTION
    Concatenates the list of words and displays them as a single message after
    which the program awaits the user's reply, which is then signalled to the
    client using the 'ask' command's exit code.

OPTIONS
    --title:text   Changes the default title ("Message") into the given text.
    --yesno        Ask Yes/No rather than OK/Cancel.

EXIT CODES
    The Nutbox-wide exit codes adhered to by all Nutbox commands are:

        0 - success; the program successfully ran to completion.
        1 - failure; the program encountered an error while executing.
        2 - failure; the program was asked to display its help text.

    These exit codes are extended by 'ask' as follows:

        100 - The user selected OK or Yes.
        101 - The user selected Cancel or No.

EXAMPLES
    ask -title:Alert! "Do you want to erase 'foo.bar'?"
    Displays the string "Do you want to erase 'foo.bar'" and waits for the user 
    to interactively select or click the OK or Cancel button.

TIPS
    1. 'ask' is very handy for script writers.
