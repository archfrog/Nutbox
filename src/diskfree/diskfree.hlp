SUMMARY
    Displays the number of free bytes on the specified disk.

SYNOPSIS
    "diskfree" target

DESCRIPTION
    Displays the number of free bytes on the disk identified by target, which
    may be a disk designator or a directory name.

OPTIONS
    N/A.

EXIT CODES
    The Nutbox-wide exit codes adhered to by all Nutbox commands are:

        0 - success; the program successfully ran to completion.
        1 - failure; the program encountered an error while executing.
        2 - failure; the program was asked to display its help text.

EXAMPLES
    diskfree .
    Displays the number of bytes available on the disk on which the current
    directory resides.

    diskfree c:
    Displays the number of bytes available on the C: drive.

TIPS
    1. A directory name may be specified instead of a drive designator.

BUGS
    1. 'diskfree' itself.  POSIX offers the 'df' command, which Nutbox should
       implement instead of the 'diskfree' command.
