//****************************************************************************
// Notice:
// The code in here is really, really pathetic.  But I haven't yet figured out
// a good way, in C#, to do GNU getopt() style processing of the input.
// Contributions are welcome!
//
// The current implementation is rather crude and has several issues:
//
//     1. The implementation does not handle "rm -fr foo bar"; each option has
//        to a separate option.
//     2. The implementation does not allow code reuse in the option parser;
//        to facilitate this, ParseLongOption() and ParseShortOption() should
//        be merged into one.  In effect, ParseLongOption() should be named
//        ParseOption() and should be called both for long and short options,
//        but this would mean that constructs such as "rm --f -r" were valid.
