This is a list of bugs or inconveniences found in Mono v2.4.2.1 while testing
the Nutbox package under Mono.  If they are real bugs, I don't know.  I just
know that they act as show-stoppers on microscopic parts of the Nutbox project.

1. INCORRECT EXIT CODE
The 'mono' command does not return the exit code of the command that was
invoked.  For instance, if I invoke 'true', which always returns a zero exit
code, 'mono' returns 255 to its caller.  This makes automatic use of the Nutbox
project virtually impossible under Mono.  On .NET 2.0 under Windows, the proper
exit code is returned. This pretty much breaks Nutbox use on *nix platforms.

FAILURE TO PROCESS CTRL-D AS END OF FILE
2. Improper behavior when reading lines from stdin; on *nix, you'd expect
Ctrl-D to mean "end of file".  The Nutbox 'cat' command just prints some
bizarre character and continues - even though it is reading from stdin.
Obviously, you cannot type Ctrl-Z as this means "suspend current process" in
most shells on *nix.
