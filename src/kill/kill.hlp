SUMMARY
    Kills a process specified by name or process id.

SYNOPSIS
    "kill" process

DESCRIPTION
    Kills (terminates) the process specified by the specified name or id.
    For safety reasons, 'kill' only allows killing one process at a time.

OPTIONS
    -9, --force   Force the process to shut down immediately.

    Any long option can be prefixed with 'no' to disable it.

EXIT CODES
    The Nutbox-wide exit codes adhered to by all Nutbox commands are:

        0 - success; the program successfully ran to completion.
        1 - failure; the program encountered an error while executing.
        2 - failure; the program was asked to display its help text.

EXAMPLES
    kill 3096
    Kills the process whose process identifier is 3096, if any.

    kill cmd
    Kills the process whose name is 'cmd', if any, or reports an error if
    multiple such processes exist in the system.

    kill -9 winamp
    Kills the specified process immediately without giving it the option of
    ignoring or rejecting the kill request.

TIPS
    None.

BUGS
