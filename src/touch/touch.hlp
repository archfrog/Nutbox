SUMMARY
    Touches (updates the time of) one or more files.

SYNOPSIS
    "touch" *option +wildcard

DESCRIPTION
    Updates the specified files' time stamps to the current time.  If a file
    does not already exist, it is created (with a length of zero).

    The time format, used by the '-time' option is the standard Nutbox time
    format: YYYY.MM.DD.HH.II.SS.LLLL.

OPTIONS
    -f, --force        Force update of read-only files.
    -r, --recurse      Process subdirectories too.
    -t, --time:value   Use the specified time instead of the current time.

    Any long option can be prefixed with 'no' to disable it.

EXIT CODES
    The Nutbox-wide exit codes adhered to by all Nutbox commands are:

        0 - success; the program successfully ran to completion.
        1 - failure; the program encountered an error while executing.
        2 - failure; the program was asked to display its help text.

EXAMPLES
    touch newfile.txt
    Assuming 'newfile.txt' does not exist, it is created as a new file.

    touch --recurse *.hlp
    Touch all help texts found in the current directory and subdiretories so as
    to make some make tool rebuild their dependents.  Not the smartest way of
    doing this, but nonetheless very commonly used.

    touch --time:2009.07.19.23.12 foo.txt
    Sets the time of 'foo.txt' to the specified time.

TIPS
    1. 'touch' is very useful with some make files.

BUGS
    Unknown.
