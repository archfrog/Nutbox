    directory name and optionally strips the specified suffix from the result.

OPTIONS
    N/A.

EXIT CODES
    The Nutbox-wide codes adhered to by all Nutbox commands are:

        0 - success; the program successfully ran to completion.
        1 - failure; the program encountered an error during execution.
        2 - failure; the program was asked to display its help text.

EXAMPLES
    basename d:\bar\foo\
    Prints the string 'foo' to the standard output device.

    basename d:\prj\foo.obj .obj
    Prints the string 'foo' to the standard output device.

TIPS
    1. 'basename' is a historical remnant from Unix systems.  Use Nutbox's
       'filename' command instead, as it can provide the exact details you
        want from any given path name.

BUGS
    Unknown.

FUTURE
    No future enhancements are planned for 'basename'.
