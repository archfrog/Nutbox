SUMMARY
    Prints the ASCII or Unicode strings embedded in one or more binary files.

SYNOPSIS
    "strings" *option +wildcard

DESCRIPTION
    Scans the specified files for strings that appear to be human-readable and
    prints those to the standard output device.

OPTIONS
    --offset         Print file offsets.
    --unicode        Attempt to parse UTF-16 (two-byte) Unicode characters.
    --width:number   Only display matches longer than this value (default: 3).

    Any long option can be prefixed with 'no' to disable it.

EXIT CODES
    The Nutbox-wide exit codes adhered to by all Nutbox commands are:

        0 - success; the program successfully ran to completion.
        1 - failure; the program encountered an error while executing.
        2 - failure; the program was asked to display its help text.

EXAMPLES
    strings ..\bin\strings.exe
    Displays all the ASCII strings that are found in '..\bin\strings.exe'

    strings --unicode ..\bin\strings.exe | more
    Displays all the Unicode strings that are found in '..\bin\strings.exe' and
    feeds those to the 'more' command so that the user can read the result.

TIPS
    1. The --unicode option is very useful on Windows or .NET executables!
