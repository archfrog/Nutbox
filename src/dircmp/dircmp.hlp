SUMMARY
    Compares the specified directories and optionally synchronizes them.

SYNOPSIS
    "dircmp" *option source target

DESCRIPTION
    Compares the source directory with the target directory, making a report
    that describes the steps necessary to make target identical to source.
    Optionally synchronizes the target with the source so that the target
    actually becomes identical to the source.

    The main features of 'dircmp' are:

       1. 'dircmp' reports a very concise and brief difference report, which
          is very suitable for further automatic processing.
       2. 'dircmp' offers the option of synchronizing the target to the source.
       3. 'dircmp' runs out-of-the-box on all .NET platforms.
       4. 'dircmp' offers full Unicode support (as does all of Nutbox).

OPTIONS
    --deep        Enable deep comparison of file data (compare contents).
    --exclude:x   Exclude directory 'x' (\x) from the comparison and update.
    --force       Force deletion of read-only files and directories.
    --full        Display equal items too.
    --progress   *Display progress information in the console title.
    --sync        Synchronize target with source.

    Any long option can be prefixed with 'no' to disable it.
    Options marked with * are enabled by default.

LEGEND
    =   The item is identical in both source and target.
    *   The item must be updated from the source.
    +   The item must be added from the source to the target.
    -   The item must be deleted from the target.

EXIT CODES
    The Nutbox-wide codes adhered to by all Nutbox commands are:

        0 - success; the program successfully ran to completion.
        1 - failure; the program encountered an error during execution.
        2 - failure; the program was asked to display its help text.

EXAMPLES
    dircmp c:\foo d:\bar
    Reports the differences between 'c:\foo' and 'd:\bar'.

    dircmp --sync c:\foo d:\bar
    Makes 'd:\bar' identical to 'c:\foo'.

    dircmp --sync --exclude:\bak c:\foo d:\bar
    Makes 'd:\bar\ identical to 'c:\foo', except 'c:\foo\bak' is ignored.

TIPS
    1. 'dircmp' is very useful to keep two disks or directory trees identical.
    2. ALWAYS run 'dircmp' without the --sync option prior to using --sync:
       'dircmp' is a program and programs contains bugs for which reason you
       should ALWAYS manually verify that the result is as you expect to be
       PRIOR to asking 'dircmp' to synchronize two directories.
    3. If 'dircmp' exits with an error, you can always rerun the tool.

BUGS
    1. 'dircmp' only handles plain files and directories.  Junctions, links,
       etc. are not supported and the function of 'dircmp' is undefined if
       such disk items are processed by 'dircmp'.
    2. 'dircmp' sucks away memory as if it got paid to do so.  In daily use,
       'dircmp' can easily use 150-200 megabytes of memory when comparing two
       distinct disks.  This is quite typical of many Windows programs, though.
    3. 'dircmp' does not support FAT drives well because these do not support
       the 64-bit time stamps that Win32 and Win64 use.

FUTURE
    1.  Some day support for junctions, links, etc. will be added.
