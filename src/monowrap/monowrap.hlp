SUMMARY
    Creates one or more shell scripts for invoking Mono for a given command.

SYNOPSIS
    "monowrap" *option +wildcard

DESCRIPTION
    Generates a Mono wrapper (*nix shell script) for each specified executable.
    This is handy for quickly making Nutbox usable on non-Windows platforms.

OPTIONS
    --chmod     Invoke 'chmod' to set attributes of generated script(s)
    --monohome  Home directory of the Mono installation.
    --recurse   Recurse subdirectories.
    --shell     Specify shell to use (default: /bin/bash)

    Any long option can be prefixed with 'no' to disable it.

EXIT CODES
    The Nutbox-wide exit codes adhered to by all Nutbox commands are:

        0 - success; the program successfully ran to completion.
        1 - failure; the program encountered an error while executing.
        2 - failure; the program was asked to display its help text.

EXAMPLES
    monowrap bin/*.exe
    Creates a Mono shell wrapper script for each of the executables (.exe)
    found in the 'bin' directory.  The script invokes Mono to execute the
    .exe file in question.

TIPS
    1. *nix usage: /bin/env mono bin/monowrap.exe bin/*.exe

BUGS
