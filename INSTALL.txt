Windows:

    1. Copy the files in the bin directory to whatever directory you fancy.
    2. Ensure the directory that now holds the executables is in the PATH.

Linux/Solaris:

    1. Invoke the command: bash ./INSTALL.sh and follow the instructions.
    2. Add the directory that now holds the executables to your PATH.

    Note: 
    If 'mono' is not in the PATH, which INSTALL.sh assumes, you should add it 
    prior to invoking INSTALL.sh.  Alternatively, you can use INSTALL.sh as a 
    reference when manually installing Nutbox.

Macintosh:

    1. I have no clue; I only used a Mac once for about an hour (by accident).
