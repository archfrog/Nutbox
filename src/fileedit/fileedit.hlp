SUMMARY
    Replaces all occurences of the specified patterns in the specified files.

SYNOPSIS
    "fileedit" *option +pattern +wildcard

DESCRIPTION
    Reads each input file into memory, performs the substitutions requested,
    and writes the files back to disk.

OPTIONS
    -b, --backup    Back up original files (to *.bak).
    -r, --recurse   Recurse subdirectories.

    Any long option can be prefixed with 'no' to disable it.

EXIT CODES
    The Nutbox-wide exit codes adhered to by all Nutbox commands are:

        0 - success; the program successfully ran to completion.
        1 - failure; the program encountered an error while executing.
        2 - failure; the program was asked to display its help text.

EXAMPLES
    fileedit --recurse 0.8.8.0=0.9.9.0 *.cs
    Bump the version number of Nutbox from v0.8.8.0 to v0.9.9.0.

    fileedit --recurse FOO=foo BAR=bar *.cs
    Replace all occurences of 'FOO' with 'foo' and all occurences of 'BAR' with
    'bar' in all C# source files in the current directory and all
    subdirectories.

TIPS
    1. Pattern is of the form 'old=new', where 'old' is the literal string to
       search for and 'new' is the string to replace with.
    2. This version of 'fileedit' always uses case-sensitive searches.
    3. Files are only written if they have changed.

BUGS
    1. 'fileedit' does not currently support the standard input device.

FUTURE
    1. Make fileedit remember the input file format (Windows, Unix,
       or Macintosh) and use that for the output files (the current
       version silently converts the output to the Windows format).
    2. Make fileedit capable of reading from the standard input device
       and write to the standard output device.  This is really a must
       for fileedit to be useful in pipe operations.
