	<h1>Nutbox To-Do</h1>
	<p>This to-do list cannot be maintained on the Internet due to the fact that
	   the author of Nutbox, Mikael Lyngvig, does not have a permanent Internet
	   connection for the time being.  Once I get such an Internet connection,
	   I plan to move Nutbox to <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">
	   www.SourceForge.net</a>.</p>

	<p>Please report bugs, enhancement requests, etc. to
	   <a href="mailto:mikael@lyngvig.org">mikael@lyngvig.org</a>.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>(high) Add 'ask' command, which allows Yes/No or Cancel/Okay questions.</li>
		<li>(high) Make 'fileedit' and 'filenameedit' fail when no files are specified.</li>
		<li>(high) Make 'cat' support binary files as well as text files.</li>
		<li>(high) Finish up automated test suite for testing each command elaborately.</li>
		<li>(medium) Add 'hexdump' utility.</li>
		<li>(low) Fix remaining issues reported by FxCop v1.36.<br>
			This is work in progress.  So far about two-thirds of the warnings
			have been fixed.  Some of the warnings obviously do not apply to
			Nutbox for which reason they will never be fixed.  This includes,
			but is not limited to, the warnings	about catching System.Exception:
			A stand-alone application MUST catch System.Exception to be a proper
			application or the user will experience undesirable scenarios.<br>
			Furthermore, the "Nested types should no be visible" error is a folly;
			using visible nested types ENHANCES readability and maintainability, IMHO.</li>
		<li>(low) Perform rudimentary test on Mono on Solaris to see if it works.<br>
			This has turned out to be such a big project that I am deferring it to later.<br>
			Currently, I am banging my head against the fact that Mono's configure script
			chokes and dies with an error near the end of the script. It seems almost
			impossible to build Mono v2.4.2.1 on Solaris/x86 - at least I don't want to
			invest ages on supporting a platform that I don't currently use myself.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Dropped issues:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>(high) Make txt2cs trim the input prior to generating the output.<br>
			The 'trim' command was made just for that; why overload 'txt2cs'?</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Fixed issues:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>(high) Fix broken 'dircmp' command - it processes "d:\" incorrectly
			because it strips the trailing slash prior to using the parameter.</li>
		<li>(low) Figure out standard, generic way of processing parameters.<br>
			The problem is that I'd like to specify the set of parameters and options
			using a suitable data structure and then let the command-line parser
			use that data structure to parse the input - sort of clean a C#
			version of GNU getopt.  Currently, this hangs on me	not wanting to
			use explicit casts everywhere in the client code.  I am	still
			contemplating the issue and will perhaps find a solution some day.</li>
		<li>(low) Make 'dircmp' use a Dictionary rather than the current Hashtable.</li>
		<li>(urgent) Make Nutbox.Options check that options are passed in the proper order.</li>
		<li>(urgent) Fix Nutbox.Options so that it handles short options with args.</li>
		<li>(urgent) Finish up the <tt>filename</tt> command: Add the diskname subcommand.</li>
		<li>(urgent) Finish up the online help texts for all commands.</li>
		<li>(urgent) Move the Information.Syntax descriptor into the help file.</li>
		<li>(urgent) Figure out why 'sort' insists on putting empty lines at the end.</li>
		<li>(high) Make <tt>rm</tt> remove read-only files if <tt>-force</tt> is in effect.</li>
		<li>(high) Make <tt>filefind</tt> capable of reading from standard input.</li>
		<li>(low) Figure out why "gnumake clean" does not delete the debug files.<br>
			:: This was caused by the empty $(NUTBOX_INVOKE) macro: GNU Make does not,
			unlike Nutmake, trim the input line AFTER macros have been expanded.  I
			assumed GNU Make did this but, alas, it did not.  I discovered this
			because Nutmake behaved in the same manner, in an initial version;
			something that I quickly corrected so Nutmake behaves nicely.</li>
		<li>(high) Create ad-hoc make utility, nutmake, which can build Nutbox on
			all platforms using the same basic Makefile.  Yeah, I'm too lazy to
			spend ages getting to know one of the very advanced build tools out
			there.  Also, I always liked meddling with development tools and
			making an ad-hoc make tool is a perfect way of enjoying life.</li>
		<li>(high) Create strongly signed assemblies.</li>
		<li>(low) Create and use AssemblyInfo.cs files for all tools in Nutbox.<br>
			:: These are now embedded in the source file of each command as well
			as in the Attributes.cs found in the Nutbox directory.</li>
