// To put it in the words of a former supervisor:
// This module defeats the purpose of .NET v2.0's Unicode support.
//
// The module probably seems nuts, but I like my POSIX-style tools to display
// POSIX-style behavior.  And I haven't figured out how to do it with .NET.
// Most likely, this is my fault and I am to blame (naughty boy!).
